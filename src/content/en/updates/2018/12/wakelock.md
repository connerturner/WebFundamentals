## What is the Wake Lock API? {: #what }

To avoid draining the battery, most devices quickly go to sleep when left
idle. While this is fine most of the time, some applications need to keep the
screen or the device awake in order to complete their work. For example, a
run-tracking app (turns the screen off, but keeps the system awake), or a game,
like [Ball Puzzle](https://ball-puzzle.appspot.com/), that uses the device
motion APIs for input.

The Wake Lock API provides a way to prevent the device from dimming and
locking the screen or prevent the device from going to sleep. This capability
enables new experiences that, until now, required a native app.

The Wake Lock API aims to reduce the need for hacky and potentially
power-hungry workarounds. It addresses the shortcomings of an older API
which was limited to simply keeping the screen on, and had a number of
security and privacy issues.

### Suggested use cases for the Wake Lock API {: #use-cases }

[RioRun](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/06/rio-running-app-marathon-course-riorun),
a web app developed by
[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/)
that takes you on a virtual audio tour of Rio, following the route of the 2016
Olympic marathon would be a perfect use case. Without wake locks, your screen
will turn off frequently, making it hard to use.

Of course, there are plenty of others:

* Kiosk-style apps where it’s important to prevent the screen from turning off.
* Web based presentation apps where it’s essential to prevent the screen
  from going to sleep while in the middle of a presentation.

Note: Big thanks to the folks at Intel, specifically Mrunal Kapade for doing
the work to implement this. We depend on a community of committers working
together to move the Chromium project forward. Not every Chromium committer
is a Googler, and they deserve special recognition!

## How to use the Wake Lock API {: #use }

Dogfood: We’re still working on the Wake Lock API, and it’s only available
behind a flag (`#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`). While in
development, bugs are expected, or it may fail to work completely.

Check out the [Wake Lock demo][demo] and [source][demo-source] for the demo.

### Wake lock types {: #wake-lock-types }

The Wake Lock API provides two types of wake locks, `screen` and `system`.
While they are treated independently, one may imply the effects of the other.
For example, a screen wake lock implies that the app should continue running.

<div class="attempt-left" id="wake-lock-screen">
  <b><code>screen</code> wake lock</b>
  <p>
    A <code>screen</code> wake lock prevents the device’s screen from turning
    off so that the user can see the information that’s displayed on screen.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="attempt-right" id="wake-lock-system">
  <b><code>system</code> wake lock</b>
  <p>
    A <code>system</code> wake lock prevents the device’s CPU from entering
    standby mode so that your app can continue running.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"></div>
Warning: We’re currently defining the permission model for `system` wake locks.
Until this work is finished, requests for `system` wake locks will be denied immediately.
You can track our progress in [crbug.com/985742](https://crbug.com/985742).

### Get a wake lock {: #get-wake-lock }

To request a wake lock, you need to call the `WakeLock.request()` method
that lives on the `window` object. You pass it the desired wake lock type as the first parameter,
which *currently* is limited to just `'screen'`. In addition,
you also need a way to abort the wake lock,
which works through the generic `AbortController` interface.
Therefore, you first create a new
[`AbortController`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController),
and then pass the controller’s
[`AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal)
as the second parameter to `WakeLock.request()`.
Two things can happen next that you need to `catch`:

- The wake lock can, after a while, just be regularly aborted,
  which you detect by checking if the exception’s name is `'AbortError'`.
  In this context, `AbortError` is actually not an error in the common sense,
  but just the way `AbortController` works.
- The browser can also refuse the request for different reasons, for example,
  because the battery charge level is too low.
  In this case, the exception’s message will contain more details.

```js
const wakeLockCheckbox = document.querySelector('#wakeLockCheckbox');

if ('WakeLock' in window) {
  let wakeLock = null;

  const requestWakeLock = () => {
    const controller = new AbortController();
    const signal = controller.signal;
    window.WakeLock.request('screen', {signal})
    .catch((e) => {
      if (e.name === 'AbortError') {
        wakeLockCheckbox.checked = false;
        console.log('Wake Lock was aborted');
      } else {
        console.error(`${e.name}, ${e.message}`);
      }
    });
    wakeLockCheckbox.checked = true;
    console.log('Wake Lock is active');
    return controller;
  };

  wakeLockCheckbox.addEventListener('change', () => {
    if (wakeLockCheckbox.checked) {
      wakeLock = requestWakeLock();
    } else {
      wakeLock.abort();
      wakeLock = null;
    }
  });
}
```

### The wake lock lifecycle {: #wake-lock-lifecycle }

When you play with the  [wake lock demo][demo], you'll notice that
wake locks are sensitive to page visibility changes as defined by the
[Page Visibility API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API),
as well as full screen changes defined by the
[Fullscreen API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API).
This means that when you minimize a tab or window where a wake lock is active
or enter full screen mode, the wake lock will automatically abort.
If you want your wake lock to be re-acquired, you need to listen for the events
that either of the APIs emit, namely the
[`visibilitychange`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/visibilitychange_event)
event of the Page Visibility API and the
[fullscreenchange](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API#Event_handlers)
event of the Fullscreen API,
and then request a new wake lock.

```js
const handleVisibilityChange = () => {
  if (wakeLock !== null && document.visibilityState === 'visible') {
    wakeLock = requestWakeLock();
  }
};

document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);
document.addEventListener('fullscreenchange', handleVisibilityChange);
```

## Best Practices {: #best-practices }

The approach you take depends on the needs of your app. However, you should use
the most lightweight approach possible for your app, to minimize your app’s
impact on system resources.

Before adding wake lock to your app, consider whether your use cases could
be solved with one of the following alternative solutions:

* If your app is performing long-running downloads, consider using
  [background fetch](/web/updates/2018/12/background-fetch).
* If your app is synchronizing data from an external server, consider using
  [background sync](/web/updates/2015/12/background-sync).

Note: Like most other powerful web APIs, the Wake Lock API is only available
when served over **HTTPS**.


## Feedback {: #feedback }

We need your help to ensure that the Wake Lock API works in a way that meets
your needs and that we’re not missing any key scenarios.

**What should the permission model look like?** When should the browser
notify the user that there’s a wake lock active? Add your thoughts to
[how should UAs infer consent to take a wakelock](https://github.com/w3c/wake-lock/issues/140)
GitHub issue.

If there are any features we’re missing, or there are scenarios that are either
difficult or impossible to implement with the current design, please file an
issue in the [w3c/wake-lock repo][issues] and provide as much detail as you can.

We’re also interested to hear how you plan to use the Wake Lock API:

* Have an idea for a use case or an idea where you’d use it?
* Do you plan to use this?
* Like it and want to show your support?
